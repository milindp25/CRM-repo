## Biggest Competitive Gaps (Executive Summary)

1. **No e-signatures** — Every major competitor has built-in e-signatures. Most impactful missing feature for onboarding and document workflows.
2. **No mobile experience** — BambooHR, Keka, Darwinbox, and GreytHR all have dedicated mobile apps. No PWA or native mobile app.
3. **No Slack/Teams integration** — Every competitor integrates with at least one collaboration tool. Table stakes for modern HR software.
4. **No benefits administration** — Gusto, BambooHR, and Rippling all offer comprehensive benefits management. Dealbreaker for US-market customers.
5. **No statutory compliance automation (India)** — Keka, GreytHR, and Darwinbox automate PF/ESI/TDS filings. Non-negotiable for the Indian market.
6. **No employee self-service payslip access** — While payslips are generated, no dedicated self-service portal exists. All 8 competitors offer this.
7. **No compensation planning tools** — Rippling and Deel both offer salary bands, pay equity analysis, and merit cycle workflows.
8. **Limited multi-country payroll** — Only US and India tax engines. Deel supports 150+ countries, Rippling 185+.
